### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will be grading you using this rubric.

For each criterion below, instructors will give you a score according to the following guidelines. "Ticking" all of the boxes for a criterion will earn a "meets expectations".

They will also assign a **Total Score**, to serve as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals. However, __the more important scores are the individual ones__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

| Score | Expectations |
| :---- | :----------- |
| **0** | _Does not meet expectations_ |
| **1** | _Meets expectactions_ |
| **2** | _Exceeds expectations_ |

## Project Workflow - Meets expectations

> Workflow is something you will likely talk about in interviews. Having quick access to materials demonstrating your project workflow will be super useful.

##### How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?
- The `readme.md` file contains any necessary installation instructions

> Make sure to update readme file to include the items described [here](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2#deliverables). It'll be really good to have for your portfolio.

- The `planning` folder contains:
  - a picture / screenshot of your ERD (up to date!)

  > :+1: You may want to quickly whiteboard an updated ERD -- you've expanded the domain model in ways you definitely want to show off. Maybe include the ERD in your readme

  - a `wireframes` directory, which in turn contains at least 2 drawings or photos of wireframes and ERDs

  > Do you have any wireframes you can put up? The app looks great -- the quotes in the footer are a nice touch. Any planning materials it will be good to have in the repo or linked to so you can get to them easily.

  - a `user_stories.md` file, which in turn contains at least 7 user stories (or a link to a Trello board or equivalent)

  > The trello board is either private or not there.

- A Github issue was submitted to the `project2` repository **by 11:00am on Friday, November 20<sup>th</sup>,** containing a link to a hosted video

> :+1:

- The video itself and/or the site on which it can be found contains a website or e-mail address through which the creator can be contacted

> :+1: It would be good to add links between the repo, youtube video, and hosted project

- The video is at least 3 minutes long, but **no more than** 5 minutes

> :+1:

- The video contains:
  - A description and demo of the app

  > :+1:

  - A code sample explaining one thing of which the creator is proud

  > :+1: That get_optimal_dates function is super cool! Really clever

  - One thing the creator would do differently next time

  > :+1: [Timeboxing is rough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law)

  - The next feature the creator would like to implement

  > :+1: You had several great ideas. This is an awesome project both as is and as a solid foundation to continue building on

## Technical Requirements - Exceeds expectations

> Killed it

##### How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?
- The app contains at least 2 models

> :+1: Six models!

- The app contains at least 1 association

> :+1: A bunch more than that. You go beyond simple associations to create really neat functionality. Great job!

- At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes

> :+1:

## Creativity / Interface - Exceeds expectations
##### How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?
- The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS

> :+1: In each of these ways absolutely. Creative, unique, and functional

- The app delivers something of value to the end user: it is not just a login button and an index page

> :+1: definitely

## Code Quality - Exceeds expectations
##### How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?
- The code follows style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indenting, modularity, and semantic naming

  > :+1: Code is super clean and readable

- The code is commented only with what is necessary to document what is happening in the code

> :+1:

- For any page, copying its source code as it appears in the **browser** and pasting it into the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) yields 0 errors

> :+1: everything I put in the validator was error free

## Deployment and Functionality - Meets expectations
##### How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?
- Cursory use of the app by an uninformed user yields no errors that "break" it

> :+1: Didn't run into any errors

- The app is deployed to Heroku (or another hosting service)

> Were you able to do this. Didn't find a link to that anywhere. If not is it something  you'd be able to do over break? The app is really impressive and you definitely want that hosted so you can show it off. If you need any help with deployment let me know.

- The contents of the creator's Github repository is identical to that of the Heroku repository

> :+1:

- The `URL` field of the Github repository contains a link to the deployed version of the app

> Make sure to add this
